<h3 align="center">punk-api</h3>


<p align= "center"> This is my Punk API react project where you're able to see a collection of beers from BrewDog, sort, filter and search for a specific beer or one that meets your preference regarding ABV percentage, pH amounts and date brewed.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Clone the repository down using bash or another terminal. Once cloned down to your local machine cd into the project folder and run the command npm install to install all the dependencies needed to work the project. 


## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To run a test go to the specified components folder and open the test file. Open a new terminal and in that terminal run the command npm run test to run all the tests written in for that component.


## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.

After all project dependencies have been installed you can run npm run start to get a live site version of the punk API project running.

### `Features of note`

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

The road-map for future features, fixes and developments are as follows:
 <ul>
    <li>Add IBU to the sort by and filter options</li>
    <li>Add a dropdown card list of beers coming from the search box onFocus that would contain all available beer selections and narrow that list down based on user input</li>
    <li>Add the ability to search based on food parings and year brewed</li>
    <li>Add more navigation features. i.e. a button on the single beer page that would take you back home. And an 'X' button to close the sort by options window.</li>
  </ul>

## Available Scripts <a name="available_scripts"></a>

In the project directory, you can run: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
